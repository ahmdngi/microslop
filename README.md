# MICROSLOP

**A brutalist, single-page manifesto tracking Microsoft’s industrial-scale generation of AI slop.**

MICROSLOP is a static website and living archive documenting how Microsoft-driven AI systems are flooding the internet with **low-quality, synthetic, unverified content** — referred to here as *AI Slop*.

This project blends editorial critique with aggressive, high-contrast web design inspired by **Brutalism** and **Cyberpunk** aesthetics.

## ⚠️ What Is “AI Slop”?

> *AI Slop* = content that is:
- Generated at scale
- Lightly or never verified
- Confidently wrong, redundant, or meaningless
- Presented as authoritative
- Deployed faster than humans can audit

MICROSLOP treats slop as **infrastructure failure**, not a novelty.

## 🧠 Philosophy
MICROSLOP is not anti‑AI.
It is anti:

- Thoughtless deployment
- Synthetic consensus
- Scale without accountability
- UX forced by slide decks
- Automation without epistemology

This project exists to archive, critique, and expose.
